-->

Hi. I am Nikola Kotur, also known as Kotnik, and I am Python and PHP developer
who is also heavy in the DevOps world.

I work and live in Paris, France, inside a wonderful company called Commerce
Guys. It goes without saying that views and opinions expressed in this blog are
not necessarily one of the company, but they probably should be.

Here, you can find my writings on techical matters, handful of quotes and
anything that might interest me in the future.
