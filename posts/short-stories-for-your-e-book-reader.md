I love to read books, and ever since I got myself a wonderful
[e-book reader](http://www.kobo.com/koboglo/) I am reading even more. But, I am
annoyed with the fact that it is hard to take a short story from the Internet
and put it on the e-book reader.

So, I armed myself with [Sigil](https://code.google.com/p/sigil/) and created
this EPUB file with the five stories I wanted to read. You can find the list
after the link. Since this file served me well, it might as well serve you, so
you can download it here, free of charge:

One thing here is important to be noted: I **do not** have a copyright on any
of these short stories, and I will remove the file if asked to do so. The
stories in the EPUB file are freely available here:

  * Stephen King - [Harvey's Dream](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/06/30/030630fi_fiction)
  * George Saunders - [Puppy](http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2007/05/28/070528fi_fiction_saunders)
  * Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. - [Harrison Bergeron](http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html)
  * Ray Bradbury - [The Veldt](http://www.veddma.com/veddma/Veldt.htm)
  * Joyce Carol Oates - [Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?](http://www.usfca.edu/jco/whereareyougoing/)

Enjoy reading!
