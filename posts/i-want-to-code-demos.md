Jonny looks around, confused, his train of thought disrupted. He collects
himself and stares at the teacher with a steady eye.

"I want to code demos," he says, his words becoming stronger and more confident
as he speaks.

"I want to write something that will change people’s perception of reality. I
want them to walk away from the computer dazed, unsure of their footing and
eyesight. I want to write something that will reach out of the screen and grab
them, make their heartbeats and breathing slow to almost a halt. I want to write
something they are reluctant to leave, knowing that nothing they experience that
day will be quite as real, as insightful, as good. I want to write demos."

Silence. The class and the teacher stare at Jonny, stunned. It is the teacher’s
turn to be confused. Jonny blushes, feeling that something more is required.
“Either that or I want to be a fireman.”
