You probably caught recent news that [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), free and automated way of issuing SSL certificates, is now [trusted](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/10/19/lets-encrypt-is-trusted.html). I can not describe how excited I am about that, as I am about any step that enhances security on the Internet - especially if it is free and easy like this one is.

To that extent, I will deploy Let's Encrypt certificate on all my websites after the one I am using now expires.

Great times are coming! Well, at least regarding SSL certs :)
